title: Installation & Project Setup
description: >-
  Now that your environment is ready (if not, go back to the Environment Setup
  Guide), let's get PhilexScholar running on your machine.
---
## 1. Get the Code

Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to keep your projects.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IT-CS-NC-Philex-Scholars/PhilexScholarV2.git
cd PhilexScholarV2
```

## 2. Install Backend Dependencies

We use **Composer** to install the PHP libraries (Laravel, etc.).

```bash
composer install
```

*This may take a few minutes as it downloads the required packages.*

## 3. Install Frontend Dependencies

We use **NPM** to install the JavaScript libraries (React, Tailwind, etc.).

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

The application needs to know your database credentials and other settings. Laravel uses a `.env` file for this.

1. **Create the file**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Generate the App Key**:
   This is used to encrypt your user sessions and other data.

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. **Edit the&#x20;****`.env`****&#x20;file**:
   Open the `.env` file in your code editor (like VS Code). Find the database section and update it to match the database you created.

   **For MySQL:**

   ```ini
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=philex_scholar
   DB_USERNAME=root      # Default for XAMPP/Laragon
   DB_PASSWORD=          # Default is empty
   ```

   **For PostgreSQL:**

   ```ini
   DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=philex_scholar
   DB_USERNAME=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

## 5. Setup the Database (Migrate & Seed)

Now we will create the tables and add some sample data (admin account, sample scholarships).

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

**What this does:**

- `migrate`: Creates tables like `users`, `scholarships`, `applications`.

- `--seed`: Fills those tables with test data (Default Admin, Sample Programs, Requirements).

## 6. Run the Application

You need to run two servers at the same time: one for the backend (PHP) and one for the frontend assets (Vite/Node).

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**

```bash
php artisan serve
```

*Output: Server running on&#x20;*[*http://127.0.0.1:8000*](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
Open a new terminal tab/window in the project folder.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 7. Access the App

Open your browser and go to:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

## 🔑 Login Credentials

Since you ran the seeder, use these default accounts:

| Role        | Email                 | Password   |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| **Admin**   | `admin@example.com`   | `password` |
| **Student** | `student@example.com` | `password` |
