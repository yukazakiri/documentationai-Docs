  Welcome to the setup guide! Before we install anything, let's understand what
  we are installing and why.


  To run PhilexScholarV2, your computer needs to speak the languages the code is
  written in.

## 🛠️ The Core Components

### 1. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)

**What is it?** The "brain" of the application.
**Why do I need it?** The backend logic (Laravel) is written in PHP. It handles data, security, and the rules of the system.

### 2. Composer

**What is it?** A "Librarian" for PHP.
**Why do I need it?** Instead of writing every piece of code from scratch, we use packages (libraries) made by others. Composer downloads and manages these for us.

### 3. Node.js & NPM

**What is it?** The "Builder" for the visual interface.
**Why do I need it?** The frontend (what you see) is built with React. Node.js compiles the raw code into something your browser understands.

### 4. Database (MySQL / PostgreSQL)

**What is it?** The "Digital Filing Cabinet".
**Why do I need it?** All user accounts, applications, and scholarship data live here.
