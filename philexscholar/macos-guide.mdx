## Option A: Laravel Herd (Recommended)

**Laravel Herd** for macOS is the gold standard. It provides a zero-config development environment.

### Steps

1. **Download**: Visit [herd.laravel.com](https://herd.laravel.com).

2. **Install**: Drag the app to your Applications folder.

3. **Launch**: Open the app. It will automatically install the latest PHP and Composer versions.

4. **Database**: Herd for Mac includes **Herd Pro** features, or you can download **DBngin** (free) to handle your MySQL/PostgreSQL database.

## Option B: Homebrew (The Manual Way)

If you prefer to manage packages yourself.

1. **Install Homebrew**:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install PHP**:

   ```bash
   brew install php
   ```

3. **Install Composer**:

   ```bash
   brew install composer
   ```

4. **Install Node.js**:

   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

## Verification

Open your terminal (Command + Space, type "Terminal") and run:

```bash
php -v
composer -V
node -v
```

You should see version numbers for all of them.
