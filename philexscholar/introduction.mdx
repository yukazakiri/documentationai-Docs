## What is PhilexScholar?

PhilexScholar is a Scholarship Management System (SMS) that bridges the gap between students seeking financial aid and administrators managing scholarship programs. It provides a seamless experience for:

- **Students**: To find relevant scholarships, apply easily, track their status, and manage requirements like community service.

- **Administrators**: To configure programs, review applications, verify documents, and process disbursements efficiently.

## Core Philosophy

The system is built around a strict **Application Lifecycle State Machine**. This ensures that every application moves through a predictable and secure flow:

1. **Draft/Application**

2. **Document Verification**

3. **Eligibility Check**

4. **Enrollment**

5. **Community Service**

6. **Disbursement**

## Technology Stack

### Backend

### Frontend
